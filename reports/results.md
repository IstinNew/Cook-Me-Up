## **5. Pair Plot Insights**  

### **Understanding the Pair Plot**  
The pair plot explores relationships between key features of the Indian Food 101 dataset. Features visualized include:  

1. **Total Time**: Combined preparation and cooking time.  
2. **Number of Ingredients**: Total count of ingredients per recipe.  
3. **Flavor Profile**: Categorization of dish flavors (e.g., spicy, sweet, savory).  
4. **Course**: Type of dish (appetizer, main course, dessert).  
5. **Region**: Geographical origin of the recipe.  

### **Key Observations**  
- **Diagonal KDE Plots**:  
  - **Total Time**: Most recipes have shorter cooking times, with a highly skewed distribution.  
  - **Number of Ingredients**: The peak occurs around 6 ingredients, the most common count.  
- **Off-Diagonal Scatter Plots**:  
  - **Total Time vs. Number of Ingredients**: Recipes with fewer ingredients tend to have shorter cooking times, though some outliers exist.  
  - **Flavor Profile vs. Course**: Distinct relationships between desserts and sweet flavors are evident.  
  - **Regional Trends**: Differences in cooking styles and ingredients across regions.  

### **Insights Derived**  
- **Regional Variations**: Highlights differences in cooking styles, ingredients, and preparation times across regions.  
- **Complex Recipes**: Identifies outliers in total time, representing more elaborate dishes.  
- **Course Patterns**: Distinct clustering of appetizers, main courses, and desserts based on flavor and complexity.
