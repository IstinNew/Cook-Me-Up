# Cook-Me-Up: Simplifying Culinary Delights with Data 🍳📊

Welcome to Cook-Me-Up! This project aims to analyze and organize cooking recipes using data analysis (Python, BigQuery SQL, Looker Studio etc.) and machine learning techniques. Our goal is to simplify meal preparation and offer users a comprehensive database of culinary delights.

### Updates
This project is a work in progress and will be updated in real-time. Stay tuned for the latest enhancements and features!

## Overview

**Project Name**: Cook-Me-Up: Simplifying Culinary Delights with Data  
**Tools and Technologies**: Python, BigQuery SQL, Looker Studio, Machine Learning  
**Dataset**: [Indian Food 101](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehaprabhavalkar/indian-food-101)  
**Project Duration**: December 16, 2024 - January 16, 2025 (excluding days for year-end vacations)

## Objectives

- Analyze and organize cooking recipes
- Provide easy-to-follow instructions, ingredients, and cooking times
